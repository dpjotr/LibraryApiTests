repro steps:

1. Delete everything from library:
(using DELETE http://localhost:5000/api/book/{idNumber} or some how else)
2. Try to post any new book to library eg:
POST http://localhost:5000/api/book
        {
            "author": "Роберт Мартин",
            "isElectronicBook": false,
            "name": "Чистый код",
            "year": 1998
        }
Expected Result:
Response code: 201, created
Body:   {
            "book": {
                "author": "Роберт Мартин",
                "id": 3,
                "isElectronicBook": false,
                "name": "Чистый код",
                "year": 1998
            }
        }
Real Result:
Response code: 500, Internal server error
Body:<!doctype html>
        <html lang=en>
        <title>500 Internal Server Error</title>
        <h1>Internal Server Error</h1>
